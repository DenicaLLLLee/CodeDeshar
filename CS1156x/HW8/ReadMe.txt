NOTE: for the import of svmutil to work, the file "libsvm.so.2" MUST be in the
      parent folder of the code calling it. Source code also requires files:
      "svm.py" and "svmutil.py" built as per libsvm installation instructions.

Maybe I'll figure out a pip install, but until then, this. - 2017-Mar-19 20:43
