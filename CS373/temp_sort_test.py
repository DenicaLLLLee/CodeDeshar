# NOTE: I finally fixed this CountingSort Algo; version from 6.006 Rec 7.
#      >What went wrong before: in the summation step, I was iterating over n
#       instead of k+1. This gave correct output on IN = [4,1,3,2,3] but wrong
#       for IN = [12,2,3,2,5,13,3,11,0]. ie: if k â‰  n roughly.
#      >Solution: iterated over length of position array. pos array len = k+1,
#       iterating from end to 0, ==> instead of index[len(pos) - 1 - i], k is
#       already len(pos) - 1, ==> index[k - i]. This correctly updates the
#       position array (C[0..k], in CLRS), ready for final step.
